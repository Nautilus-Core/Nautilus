# 🌊 Nautilus

**Exploring the depths of the ocean with open-source technology.**

---

## 📌 About the Project
Nautilus is an open-source project dedicated to the study and monitoring of the oceans, using technology to collect, process and make available data about the marine depths. The mission is to create accessible tools for scientists, researchers and underwater exploration enthusiasts.

## 🎯 Objective
Our goal is to develop a digital infrastructure that facilitates the collection and visualization of information about the oceans. This includes:
- APIs for accessing oceanographic data in real time.
- Interactive visualization of underwater maps.
- Algorithms for analyzing maritime patterns.
- Integration with sensors and IoT devices to collect information.

## 🚀 How the project began
Nautilus emerged from a passion for marine exploration and technology. The project was started by [Your Name or Username], who saw the need for an open platform to facilitate ocean research. Over time, we hope that more contributors will join to improve and expand the functionality.

## 🏗 Project Structure
Nautilus is made up of different repositories within the organization:
- **`Nautilus-API`**: The heart of the project, containing the API and main algorithms.
- **`Nautilus-UI`**: Web interface for visualizing oceanographic data.
- **`Nautilus-Docs`**: Documentation and contribution guides.
- **`Nautilus-Dataset`**: Set of datasets related to the oceans.
